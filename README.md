# zBroadcast
### A dead simple broadcasting plugin (and I mean simple)

My first CraftBukkit/Spigot plugin, all it does is broadcast
messages for my personal minecraft server.

## Config.yml

- _broadcast-tag:_ prefix for broadcasting, can be null.
- _delay:_ delay in java timer (not minecraft!); ie. 1000 = 1 second.
- _messages:_ List of messages.

## Building

Can use anything that uses maven
